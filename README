To compile, type

  make

Note: feel free to comment -fopenmp flag in Make file if you fail to compile 
with "error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'".
You may put a perl script in $HOME/bin named ssrt, which will run bin/ssrt with 
any parameters supplied, by 

  ./install_perl

To run, type

  ssrt parameterfile.par

(or ./ssrt parameterfile.par if you choose to copy binary into current working
directory)

To clean up, type

  make clean

This will remove all files under obj and the binary file bin/ssrt.

For user defined models, go to src/user_models. Create and modify any cpp file.
You may refer to any existing cpp files there or refer to src/model/model.cpp to
see what you can do with this file. 

Remember to change the Makefile correspondingly for any user defined models. To
do so, modify the filename after "PROBLEM_FILE = " in line 3. Note that the 
suffix cpp is mendatory.
